    - Numpy
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib.pyplot
    - Scikit learn
    - Seaborn
    - Collections

## Files included

## Process involved
- The process started with the survey understanding. Before I start the exploratory analysis, I checked all questions to assess which one make sense for my blog post.
- Once I have a clear view regarding the questions, I started to assess the database and prepare the analysis.

## Conclusion
- You should think about reskilling even if you do not want to break into the tech field
- Learn a new hard skill is painful, but it pays off. Do not give up!
- As a bonus, during the journey of learn coding, you will develop highly important soft skills that you will use in your life
